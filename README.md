# Lodybo.com Gatsby/Ghost theme

This repo contains the code to my [Ghost blog](https://www.lodybo.com).
The Jira board with the issue list is situated [here](https://lodybo.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/LB/boards/2).

This site gets build in Gatsby Cloud whenever a change in my blog's content collection is detected (e.g. a new blog post is published).

## Development
To start working:

```shell
> npm start
```
